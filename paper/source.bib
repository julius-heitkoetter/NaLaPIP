abstract = {Summary This chapter illustrates the use of probabilistic techniques in natural language pragmatics and semantics with a concrete formal model. This model shows that a probabilistic framework for natural language is possible and productive. The chapter provides background on probabilistic modeling and stochastic ?-calculus, and introduce a running example scenario: the game of tug-of-war. It describes a formal fragment of English suitable for the running scenario. Using this fragment the chapter illustrates the emergence of non-monotonic effects in interpretation and the interaction of ambiguity with background knowledge. The chapter then describes pragmatic interpretation of meaning as probabilistic reasoning about an informative speaker, who reasons about a literal listener. It discusses the role of semantic indices in this framework and shows that binding these indices at the pragmatic level allows us to deal with several issues in context-sensitivity of meaning, such as the interpretation of scalar adjectives.}

abstract = {Previous research indicates that the human decision-making process is quite non-linear and that non-linear models would be more suitable than linear models for developing advanced decision-making models. In our study, we tested this generally held hypothesis by applying linear and non-linear models to experts' decision-making behavior and measuring the predictive accuracy (predictive validity) and valid non-linearity. As a result, we found that non-linearity in the decision-making process is positively related to the predictive validity of the decision. Secondly, in modeling the human decision-making process, we found that valid non-linearity is positively related to the predictive validity of non-linear models. Thirdly, we found that the more non-linearity is inherent in the decision-making process, the more non-linear models are effective. Therefore, we suggest that a preliminary analysis of the characteristics of expert decision-making is needed when knowledge-based models such as expert systems are being developed. We also verify that the lens model is effective in evaluating the predictive validity of human judgment and in analyzing the validity and non-linearity of the human decision-making process.}

abstract = {I am struck by how little is known about so much of cognition. One goal of this paper is to argue for the need to consider a rich set of interlocking issues in the study of cognition. Mainstream work in cognition—including my own—ignores many critical aspects of animate cognitive systems. Perhaps one reason that existing theories say so little relevant to real world activities is the neglect of social and cultural factors, of emotion, and of the major points that distinguish an animate cognitive system from an artificial one: the need to survive, to regulate its own operation, to maintain itself, to exist in the environment, to change from a small, uneducated, immature system to an adult, developed, knowledgeable one. Human cognition is not the same as artificial cognition, if only because the human organism must also be concerned with the problems of life, of development, of survival. There must be a regulatory system that interacts with the cognitive component. And it may well be that it is the cognitive component that is subservient, evolved primarily for the benefit of the regulatory system, working through the emotions, through affect. I argue that several concepts must become fundamental parts of the study of cognition, including the roles of culture, of social interaction, of emotions, and of motivation. I argue that there are at least 12 issues that should comprise the study of cognition, and thereby, the field of Cognitive Science. We need to study a wide variety of behavior before we can hope to understand a single class. Cognitive scientists as a whole ought to make more use of evidence from the neurosciences, from brain damage and mental illness, from cognitive sociology and anthropology, and from clinical studies of the human. These must be accompanied, of course, with the study of language, of the psychological aspects of human processing structures, and of artificially intelligent mechanisms. The study of Cognitive Science requires a complex interaction among different issues of concern, an interaction that will not be properly understood until all parts are understood, with no part independent of the others, the whole requiring the parts, and the parts the whole.}
