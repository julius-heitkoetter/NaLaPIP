{"task_id": 41, "prompt_text": "\nYou will output code to a probabilistic programming language built in java script. The code you output will be a conditional for a world that starts with 8 purple and blue boxes, stacked on top of each other, on a platform. Please only output a single line of code, nothing else.\n\nThe following are the predicates you may use. You can only use these predicates, do not invent other predicates.\nvar isOnPlatform = function(obj) {{\n    return obj.y < 325;\n  }}\n  \n  var isNotOnPlatform = function(obj) {{\n    return !(obj.y < 325);\n  }}\n  \n  var isLeftOfPlatform = function(obj) {{\n    return obj.y > 325 && obj.x < 175;\n  }}\n  \n  var isNotLeftOfPlatform = function(obj) {{\n    return !(obj.y > 325 && obj.x < 175);\n  }}\n  \n  var isRightOfPlatform = function(obj) {{\n    return obj.y > 325 && obj.x > 425;\n  }}\n  \n  var isNotRightOfPlatform = function(obj) {{\n    return !(obj.y > 325 && obj.x > 425);\n  }}\n  \n  var isPurple = function(obj) {{\n    return obj.color==\"purple\";\n  }}\n  \n  var isRed = function(obj) {{\n    return obj.color==\"red\";\n  }}\n  \n  var isLarge = function(obj) {{\n    return obj.dims[0] > 25 || obj.dims[1] > 25;\n  }}\n  \n  var isNotLarge = function(obj) {{\n    return !(obj.dims[0] > 25 || obj.dims[1] > 25);\n  }}\nBelow are some examples \n\nEnglish: After some time has passed, will there be more than 3 boxes on the platform?\nCode: filter(isOnPlatform, finalBoxes).length > 3\n\nEnglish: After some time has passed, wil there be any boxes to the left of the platform?\nCode: filter(isLeftOfPlatform, finalBoxes).length > 0\n\nEnglish: After some time has passed, will there be more than 2 blue boxes on the platform?\nCode: filter(isOnPlatform, filter(isBlue, finalBoxes)).length > 2\n\nEnglish: After some time has passed, will there be more blue boxes to the left of the platform than purple boxes?\nCode: filter(isOnPlatform, filter(isBlue, finalBoxes)).length > filter(isOnPlatform, filter(isPurple, finalBoxes)).length\n\nEnglish: After some time has passed, will there be any large boxes to the left of the platform?\nCode: filter(isOnPlatform, filter(isLarge, finalBoxes)).length > 0\n\nEnglish: After some time has passed, will most of the boxes have fallen off of the platform?\nCode: filter(isNotOnPlatform, filter(isLarge, finalBoxes)).length > filter(isOnPlatform, filter(isLarge, finalBoxes)).length\n\nEnglish: After some time has passed, will there be an even number of purple boxes on the platform?\nCode: filter(isOnPlatform, filter(isPurple, finalBoxes)).length % 2 == 0\n\nEnglish: After some time has passed, will some of the purple blocks have fallen off the platform.\nCode: filter(isNotOnPlatform, filter(isPurple, finalBoxes)).length > 0\n\nEnglish: After some time has passed, will the number of blocks on the platform be divisible by 3?\nCode: \n"}
